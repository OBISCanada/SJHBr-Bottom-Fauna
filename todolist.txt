All done except: a6, a7, c1, c2

A) my revised ToDo items as of Feb 26, 1-3 are done. 

1. change contientOcean='Atlantic' to   continent='North America' and waterBody='Atlantic Ocean' - done 

2. check if identifiers are unique(occurrenceID and catalogNumber) ? done
 
3. fix concatenated fields as the labels were coming out weird ? done

4. script to pull the metadata info from the IPT DwC file generated by the script : Temporal, geographic and taxonomic extents - done

5. missing the part related to location. For each station need to assign Locality; LocationID and LocationAccordingTo as well as Ocean,country, province, etc. - done 

* consider changing column names in spreadsheet table, especially those in the location table  to match DwC (e.g. locaionID=z$station, 
* locationAccordingTo=z$georeferenceSources, locationRemarks=georeferenceremarks)

6. change various concatenated fields (OccuurenceID) to include prefixes (station=XI) so that one can visually read the assigned values 

7. missing bottom type. This should be added. ([you] recommend that for version 1 of this dataset we continue without these measurements) 

8. review verbatimlocationName – [you] assigned harbour and estuary as defaults but individual stations could have been assigned better names. This info is in the report and should be set during the ‘cleaning’ section. - Done  

B) what I got from Mary’s emails since Feb 26 …

1. Provide ipt.csv as a zipped file - done
2. Need to calculate year, month and day - done
3. if date not yyyy-mm-dd then include a verbatimEventdate column ? is yyyy-mm-dd ? done 
4. Depth is included as verbatimDepth but since it is a real number it should be included in fields MinimumDepthInMeters and MaximumdepthInmeters - done
5. Check that classification columns are fully populated i.e. class, order, family, genus, etc - done
6. if  zero abundances are real set  DwC occurrenceStatus = ‘absence’. - done

c)  hints that I got from looking at OBIS DwC template and http://iobis.github.io/presentation/darwincore/#1

1. identificationQualifier - A brief phrase or a standard term ("cf.", "aff.") to express the determiner's doubts about the Identification  - done
2. OrganismQuantityType= biomassG - allows for weights
3. ScientificNameID -  done
4. TaxonRank – will aid in describing taxonomic extent as mentioned in A-4 and B-1 ? done
