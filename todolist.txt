All done except: a6, a7, c1, c2

A) my revised ToDo items as of Feb 26, 1-3 are done. 

1. change contientOcean='Atlantic' to   continent='North America' and waterBody='Atlantic Ocean' - done-FIX! 
***MK these fields especially WATERBODY should be assigned using info from a gazetteer -- The location worksheet should contain this info as it was set at Bay of Fundy for most of the stations (not for the stations in the estuary , these were left blank)

2. check if identifiers are unique(occurrenceID and catalogNumber) ? done
 
3. fix concatenated fields as the labels were coming out weird ? done

4. script to pull the metadata info from the IPT DwC file generated by the script : Temporal, geographic and taxonomic extents - done

5. missing the part related to location. For each station need to assign Locality; LocationID and LocationAccordingTo as well as Ocean,country, province, etc. - done 


* consider changing column names in spreadsheet table, especially those in the location table  to match DwC (e.g. locaionID=z$station, 
* locationAccordingTo=z$georeferenceSources, locationRemarks=georeferenceremarks)
***MK please check the location worksheet - the latest file uploaded to the IPT still had ocean=Atlantic; plus the georeference terms in the zipped file did not match the adopted values

6. change various concatenated fields (OccuurenceID) to include prefixes (station=XI) so that one can visually read the assigned values 

7. missing bottom type. This should be added. ([you] recommend that for version 1 of this dataset we continue without these measurements) 

8. review verbatimlocationName Ð [you] assigned harbour and estuary as defaults but individual stations could have been assigned better names. This info is in the report and should be set during the ÔcleaningÕ section. - Done  

B) what I got from MaryÕs emails since Feb 26 É

1. Provide ipt.csv as a zipped file - done
2. Need to calculate year, month and day - done
3. if date not yyyy-mm-dd then include a verbatimEventdate column ? is yyyy-mm-dd ? done 
****MK populate eventDate and the individual day, month and year fields. Populate the VerbatimDate IF the source contained date in a non standard format

4. Depth is included as verbatimDepth but since it is a real number it should be included in fields MinimumDepthInMeters and MaximumdepthInmeters - done
5. Check that classification columns are fully populated i.e. class, order, family, genus, etc - done
6. if  zero abundances are real set  DwC occurrenceStatus = ÔabsenceÕ. - done

c)  hints that I got from looking at OBIS DwC template and http://iobis.github.io/presentation/darwincore/#1

1. identificationQualifier - A brief phrase or a standard term ("cf.", "aff.") to express the determiner's doubts about the Identification  - done
****MK identificationQualifer and taxonRemarks should be part of the taxonMatch worksheet and not set by the programmer. However it would be useful for the programmer to review content in the Worksheet(s) before processing.

2. OrganismQuantityType= biomassG - allows for weights
****MK if abundance is present then do not use biomass in this field. Biomass is a measurement and the data type needs to be carefully assigned.

3. ScientificNameID -  done
4. TaxonRank Ð will aid in describing taxonomic extent as mentioned in A-4 and B-1 ? done
****MK this entry should originate from the taxonmatch worksheet.
